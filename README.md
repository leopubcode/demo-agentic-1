# react-ts-tailwind-trpc

A template to start a new monorepo project using TurboRepo, npm, React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, React Router. Then on the backend, Node, Express, tRPC, and database is left out of the tech stack, just choose your own.

The core project currently exports a tRPC router, however it can be changed to simply export functions or classes that perform the business logic as a service layer. This core project can be imported into other node.js project. In this case, it is mainly used in the API app, which is a very basic Express API wrapper that exposes a tRPC server. However, it can also be used to create a GraphQL API, a WebSocket API, or REST API. It can also be imported into worker projects, scripts, or CLI or any type of Node project. You could choose to keep the core project just a service layer without coupling it with the tRPC layer, however I decided to keep things simple and made core export a tRPC router.

If you choose to use multiple clients, you can create your own component library and import it into multiple web apps. However, I did not add a components project since not all projects need them.
